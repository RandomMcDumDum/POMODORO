This timer will automatically setup to be 40 minutes long, and a button initiate the countdown. After 40 minutes have gone by, it will count up how much longer you have studied past 40 minutes and will force you to take a break at 60 minutes. 
At 40 minutes, pressing the button will start rest mode which is 20 minutes long. Long enough to watch a short episode show, or maybe try your hand at one of the cups on mario kart 8. the point is, its long enough to actually relax for a good bit.

Progress bar under the timer to give visual of how much longer left to go. 

A gif that plays while working and while resting next to the timer for some cuteness. Dont want it feeling like all work. Might put some pandas or animals to make it more me. Decorations later.
